Building and Running the Blackjack Game
=======================================

The project was built using Java, Maven and JUnit.

The steps to build and run the program are as follows:

1) Unzip the blackjackApp.zip file into a directory.

2) Next, cd to into the blackjackApp directory to where the pom.xml exist.

3) Type " mvn clean install "
    ( this compiles the project into a jar file and also runs the junit tests )
   
4) View the blackjackUML.jpg image in the same directory as the pom.xml.
    ( this is the class diagram saved as an image )
   
4) Next, cd to the "target" directory.

5) Type... " java -jar blackjackApp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar "
    ( The game should start...)
	
6) Have Fun Playing!
